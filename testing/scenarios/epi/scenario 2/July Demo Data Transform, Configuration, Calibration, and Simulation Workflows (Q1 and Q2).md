**1. Begin Test**
1. **Login:**
- Go to [Terarium Staging](https://app.staging.terarium.ai/).
- Use the test account credentials:
	- **Email:** qa@test.io
	- **Password:** askem-quality-assurance

2. **Create a New Project:**
- Create a new project and name this **QA Epi S3*2.

**1. Find and Upload Resources into Terarium**
1. Upload the following resources into your project space
	1. [SEIRHD Model](**[https://github.com/liunelson/mira/blob/nliu/experiment/notebooks/nliu/monthlydemo202407Q1.json](https://github.com/liunelson/mira/blob/nliu/experiment/notebooks/nliu/monthlydemo202407Q1.json)**)
2. Upload this dataset, which contains data for cases and deaths for LA county:
	1. [Cases and deaths](https://github.com/DARPA-ASKEM/program-milestones/blob/74-july-2024-scenario/Monthly_Scenarios_CIEMSS/July_2024_Scenario/LA_county_covid_data.csv)
3. Upload US counties dataset for cases and deaths by state and county
	1. [US Cases and deaths](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/us-counties-2021.csv)

**Note: you can either process the US Cases and deaths data showcasing the data transformation workflow or you can upload the Cases and deaths data for LA county that has already been processed. **

**2. Process Dataset: Data Transformation Workflow**
	1. Create a new workflow named `Process Dataset`and add the `US Cases and Deaths` dataset to the canvas.
	2. Add the `Data Transformation`operator and connect this to the `US Cases and Deaths` dataset.
	3. Open the editor for the `Data Transformation` operator. You will need to interact with the LLM or write code to do the following:
		1. Filter the data for Los Angeles County, California:
			1. filtered_df = df[(df['county'] == "Los Angeles") & (df['state'] == "California")]
		2. Convert the date column to datetime
		3. Print the row for 2021-10-23 to estimate Recovered population
		4. Sort the data by date
		5. # Filter the data between the specified dates:
			1. start_date = '2021-10-28'
			2. end_date = '2021-12-28'
		6. Drop unwanted columns
			1. final_df.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)
			2. final_df.index.name = 'Timestamp'
			3. final_df = final_df[['cases', 'deaths']]
			4. final_df.head()
	4. Save the `final_df`as a new dataset and name this as `LA County Covid Data`
 
**2. Configure the Model
1. Create a new workflow canvas and name this `Model Configuration`
2. Add the `SEIRHD Model`to the workflow canvas an connect this to the `model configuration` operator. Configure the model using estimated parameter values and initial conditions at the 2021-10-28 and save this as default configuration. Below are initial conditions and parameters 
	1. Set the initial conditions to the following ([based on Sabina's Notebook](https://github.com/DARPA-ASKEM/program-milestones/blob/74-july-2024-scenario/Monthly_Scenarios_CIEMSS/July_2024_Scenario/July_2024_Notebook.ipynb) )
		1. "S" Susciptable
			1. S_u = 2324633.64
			2. S_v = 5977629.36
		2. "I" Infected
			1. I_u = 3458.66666666667
			2. I_v = 1729.33333333333
		3. "E" Exposed
			1. H = 673
			2. R = 1484896
			3. D = 26604
		
	2. Set parameters with uncertainty
		1. N (unit: person)
			1. Constant
			2. Constant =  9830000
		2. NPI_mult
			1. Uniform
			2. Min = .999
			3. Max = 1.001
		3. beta
			1. Uniform
			2. Min = .09
			3. Max = .11
		4. vacc_mult
			1. Constant
			2. Constant = .5
		5. r_EI
			1. Uniform
			2. Min = .1
			3. Max = .25
		6. r_IH_u
			1. Uniform
			2. Min = .005
			3. Max = .0055
		7. r_IH_v
			1. Uniform
			2. Min = .001
			3. Max = .0015
		8. r_HR
			1. Uniform
			2. Min = .007
			3. Max = .015
		9. r_HD
			1. Uniform
			2. Min = .007
			3. Max = .015
		10. r_IR_u
			1. Uniform
			2. Min = .1
			3. Max = .2
		11. r_IR_v
			1. Uniform
			2. Min = .15
			3. Max = .2
	3. Save as `Initial Config` and return to the workflow canvas.
	4. Add the `Simulate with PyCIEMSS`operator and connect with the `Initial Config.`Open the editor and set the simulation parameters to the following:
		1. Start time = 0
		2. End time = 151
		3. Number of samples = 100
		4. Method = dopri5
		
**3. Calibrate and Forecast Model **
1. Create a new workflow and name this `Calibrate and Forecast Model`
2. Add the `SEIRHD`model and the `LA County Covid Data` to the workflow canvas
3. Add the `Model Configuration` operator and connect this to the `SEIRHD model`.
4. Add  the `Calibrate with PyCIEMSS`operator and connect the `SEIRHD model` and the `LA County Covid Data.` Open the operator to set up the calibration.
4. Map the model variable to the dataset variable by selecting `Add mapping.`You can also select `automap` to do this automatically; however you will need to verify that the mappings are correct.
		1. Map dataset  to the appropriate model variables: C to cases and D to deaths
5. Set the number of samples to 100, iterations to 100, and end time to 100 and run calibration.
6. View the loss chart, showing the loss value as a function of the solver iterations. Save as new dataset `Calibrated Model Result`
7.  Add the `Simulate with PyCIEMSS` operator to the workflow canvas and connect this to the `SEIRHD Model` and the `Configured Result` from the previous step. Set the simulation parameters as following:
	1. Start time =  0 
	2. End time = 100 
	3. Number of samples =  100 .
	4. Method = dopri5
8. Run the simulation, and save as a new data set named `Simulate Model Result.`
9. Add the `Calibrated Model Result` and `Simulate Model Result` to the workflow canvas and connect the two datasets with the `transform dataset` operator.
	1. Interact with the LLM or write code to plot the calibrate and simulate outputs on the same chart. 
	2. Interact with the LLM or write code to plot the number of hospitalizations for the `Simulate Model Result`
	3. View plots from  the 90 day forecast for the previous task. Determine if any day is greater than or equal to 3000. 
	4. You should also view the `90 day forecast`data set to quickly see the min and max values for `H and C.`Make a note of these values as you will need to refer back to them in a later task.
