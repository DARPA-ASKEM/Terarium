LATEXT_STYLE_GUIDE = """
1) Derivatives must be written in Leibniz notation (for example, '\\frac{d X}{d t}'). Equations that are written in other notations, like Newton or Lagrange, should be converted.
2) First-order derivative must be on the left of the equal sign
3) the use of '(t)' should be avoided
4) Avoid superscripts and LaTeX superscripts '^', particularly to denote sub-variables
5) Subscripts using LaTeX '_' are permitted. However, Ensure that all characters used in the subscript are surrounded by a pair of curly brackets '{...}'
6) Avoid parentheses
7) Avoid capital sigma and pi notations for summation and product
8) Avoid non-ASCII characters when possible
9) Avoid using homoglyphs
10) Avoid words or multi-character names for variables and names. Use camel case to express multi-word or multi-character names
11) Do not use '\\cdot' or '*' to indicate multiplication. Use whitespace instead.
12) Avoid using notation for mathematical constants like 'e' and 'pi'. Use their actual values up to 3 decimal places instead.
